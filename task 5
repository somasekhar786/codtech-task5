Migrating data between databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL involves several steps to ensure
data integrity and consistency. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to approach this task, 
including an example migration script and a summary report template.

step:1-preparation
Backup Data: Always create backups of your source database to prevent data loss.
Assess Schema Differences: Identify any differences in data types, constraints, and other
schema elements between MySQL and PostgreSQL.

step:2-export data from sql
use mysqldump to export data from sql in bash

mysqldump -u username -p database_name > database_name.sql

step:3-convert the dump file
Use tools like pgloader to convert and load the MySQL dump file into PostgreSQL. Pgloader
handles most of the conversion nuances automatically

step-4:import the data into postgresql
Use psql to import the converted data into PostgreSQL:

psql -U username -d database_name -f database_name.sql

An example for migration script
Here's a simple example using pgloader to migrate data from MySQL to PostgreSQL:

# Install pgloader
apt-get install pgloader

# Create a pgloader script (e.g., migrate.load)
LOAD DATABASE
     FROM mysql://username:password@localhost/source_db
     INTO postgresql://username:password@localhost/target_db
WITH include drop, create tables, create indexes, reset sequences
SET maintenance_work_mem to '64MB', work_mem to '8MB'
ALTER schema 'source_db' rename to 'public'
CAST type datetime to timestamptz
    drop typemod
CAST type int(1) to boolean using tinyint-to-boolean
;

# Run the pgloader script
pgloader migrate.load

this is how use migration script

Database Migration Summary Report

Date: [Insert Date] Source Database: MySQL Target Database: PostgreSQL

Migration Process Overview:

Preparation: Backups were created and schema differences were assessed.

Data Export: Data was exported from MySQL using mysqldump.

Data Conversion: The dump file was converted using pgloader.

Data Import: Converted data was imported into PostgreSQL using psql.

Data Integrity Checks:

Record Counts: Verified that record counts in all tables match between source and target databases.

Schema Comparison: Ensured that all schema elements (tables, columns, constraints) were accurately migrated.

Sample Data Verification: Conducted spot checks on sample data to verify accuracy.

Issues Encountered:
